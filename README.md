This is a repo containing an old discord zero-click rce.                           
Found originally by me, only around 3 people ever got to lay eyes on it.

**PATCHED 08/20/2021**

### Ruby example
> ```ruby
> payload = "alert('Hello, World.')"
> discordClient = Discord::Image::Sender.new("http://link.to/image.png")
> discordClient.embed(payload)
> puts discordClient.instance_variable_get :@processed
> ```

### Explaination
This exploit was discovered because of a previous 'exploit' with discord image caching.               
See here: https://github.com/ecriminal/Exploit-Discord-Cache-System-PoC

*This works because of the fact Discord uses electron and node-js*
When Discord was processes each and every image, it is loaded into the computer's memory.
However, when its loaded it is possible to exploit how electron parses images.

So, the ruby library I wrote is extremely helpful in taking advantage of this.

### Use cases
Since this is patched, you may use this to learn about security and why secure code is so important.
This module also includes the **`context-isolation`** exploit, found in a bug bounty.
